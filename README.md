## Finishing Remarks & Thoughts

This project took about 5-6 hours to complete and I'm happy with the result.

## Features & Improvement 

* __Animations__ : First time using simple CSS animations

* __Design__ : Happy with the colors, layout and overall look. I think that it's probably not optimal and maybe a bit too much for a simple RPS game, but nevertheless I'm happy with how clean it looks

* __Responsiveness__ : All elements on the site properly scale with screen size (including mobile devices!)
